        <p class="paragraph">For the first time I am starting to feel like I may be able to work in the tech field. I have always been decently "tech savy", but I would never have considered myself as someone who was capable of working in a tech career. I always thought it would end up being either my husband or my brother-in-law, because they have always been big gamers and quick to learning pretty much anything related to technology. My husband built his own pc and my brother-in-law has actually taken classes on coding. He did <em>well</em> in those classes too. I was the one with no clue what to do if my computer froze for even a second. After my previous job where I was pretty much on my own when it came to trouble-shooting my own computer issues and fast-forward to my current job where I have support and opportunities to expand my skills, I <em>finally</em> feel like I can do this. Maybe. <em>Maybe.</em></p>

        <p class="paragraph">It's so crazy to me to think of how much my life has changed in less than a year, all thanks to a new job. I wouldn't even say it's the <em>actual</em> job that changed my life, rather the work-life balance and the overall work load that came with it. The job itself doesn't really matter so much to me anymore. I don't really care what it is that I'm doing, so long as the pay is decent, I enjoy my work-environment, and my work-life balance is, well, <strong>balanced</strong>. I actually have both the energy and the enthusiasm to <strong>do</strong> things again. I actually have time to work a full 8, come home for a nap, make dinner, <em>and</em> go to the gym. Not that I actually do. But I <em>could</em> if I wanted to. But I have been able to cook decent dinners, do chores, and run errands during the week, which would have been unheard of to me less than a year ago. I actually get to see my husband for more than an hour every day <strong>and</strong> I get to spend every weekend with him. I get to sit down and eat breakfast with him every Saturday and Sunday, and <strong>that</strong> is priceless to me.</p>
